# Module 001: Core Fund Management - Product Strategy

## Overview

This module implements the foundational fund management functionality that mirrors BlackRock BUIDL's core operations. It establishes the basic infrastructure for a **tokenized fixed income fund** on Solana, enabling users to deposit stablecoins and receive proportional fund shares backed by a diversified portfolio of fixed income assets.

## BlackRock BUIDL Reference Model

### Key Mechanisms to Mimic
1. **Daily NAV Calculation**: Fund value recalculated daily based on underlying fixed income asset performance
2. **Proportional Share Distribution**: Users receive fund tokens proportional to their investment
3. **Same-Day Settlement**: Deposits and withdrawals processed within the same trading day
4. **$1 Minimum Investment**: Extremely low barrier to entry
5. **Professional Asset Management**: Institutional-grade fixed income asset selection and management

### BUIDL Fund Characteristics
- **Assets Under Management**: $500M+ (as of 2024)
- **Yield**: Typically 4.5-5.2% APY
- **Expense Ratio**: 0.25% annually
- **Share Price**: Maintained close to $1.00 through daily NAV adjustments
- **Liquidity**: Daily redemptions with T+0 settlement

## Strategic Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Replicate BUIDL Liquidity**: Enable same-day deposits and withdrawals
2. **Match Yield Performance**: Target 4-5% APY competitive with BUIDL
3. **Exceed Accessibility**: No geographic restrictions, lower minimums ($10 vs $1)
4. **Improve Transparency**: All holdings and performance visible on-chain
5. **Reduce Costs**: Lower management fees through automation (0.15% vs 0.25%)

### Competitive Advantages
- **24/7 Operations**: Unlike BUIDL's business hours limitation
- **Global Access**: No accredited investor requirements
- **Programmable**: Smart contract integration capabilities
- **Lower Fees**: Reduced operational costs through automation
- **Real-time Transparency**: All transactions and holdings public

## Fixed Income Asset Strategy

### Supported Asset Classes

#### Tier 1: Government Securities (Initial Focus)
- **U.S. Treasury Bills** (3-month to 1-year maturities)
- **U.S. Treasury Notes** (2-10 year maturities)
- **Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)**
- **Federal Agency Securities** (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac)

#### Tier 2: High-Grade Corporate (Phase 2)
- **Investment-Grade Corporate Bonds** (AAA to BBB ratings)
- **Commercial Paper** (short-term corporate debt)
- **Certificates of Deposit** (bank-issued CDs)

- **Inflation-Linked Bonds** (global TIPS equivalents)

### Asset Selection Criteria
- **Credit Rating**: Minimum investment grade (BBB/Baa3 or higher)
- **Liquidity**: Daily trading volume >$1M for secondary market access
- **Maturity**: Target weighted average maturity of 30-180 days for liquidity
- **Yield**: Optimize risk-adjusted returns within safety parameters
- **Diversification**: No single issuer >10% of portfolio (excluding U.S. Treasury)

## Implementation Philosophy

4. **User Experience**: Simple, intuitive interactions regardless of underlying complexity
5. **Composability**: Enable integration with other DeFi protocols

### Technical Strategy
- **Modular Asset Support**: Flexible architecture to add new fixed income asset types
- **Universal Pricing**: Standardized pricing oracles for all supported assets
- **Risk Management**: Automated portfolio rebalancing and risk monitoring
- **Upgradeable Contracts**: Support protocol improvements while maintaining security

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets
- **TVL Growth**: $1M in 3 months, $10M in 6 months
