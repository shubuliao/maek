   - Validate all inputs and constraints

2. **Code Review Focus**:
   - Check for reentrancy vulnerabilities
   - Verify proper error handling
   - Ensure access controls are correct
   - Review economic incentives and potential exploits

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use `npm audit` and `cargo audit`
   - Pin dependency versions in production
